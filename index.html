        I recently joined the community of MLH (within the past month) and discovered their Beginner's Week during GHW! 
        It sounded like such a good oppportunity for me to learn the fundamentals and basic concepts of CS!

          I have a bit of background in HTML/CSS/JS as I've completed freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Course back in 2022.
          I've also spent this past summer (July-August of 2024) as a front-end engineer intern at a startup. 
          To be very honest though, I had no prior knowledge of JS before applying to the internship, so I quickly taught myself the bare-minimum basics of JS in a single month.
          Obviously, that was not enough time for me to learn about JS in depth (side note: I ended up using TypeScipt for my internship). Since teaching myself JS for a month, I haven't had the change to learn more about it since then. 
          Hence, I registered for this event:
